## Mimicking Tree Boosters with Neural Nets Using SHAP Values
Neural nets are state of the art on image and textual data. However, tree boosting algorithms reign supreme when tabular data is considered. In this project we suggest a novel technique of training a Student network which learns from a Teacher XGBoost model, mimicking SHAP values as a surrogate to the rich feature representation usually mimicked when both Student and Teacher models are neural networks.
